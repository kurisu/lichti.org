Christopher Lichti's personal website, rebuilt for fun and learning in January 2015.

=== Dependencies

* Ruby 2.2.0p0
* PostgreSQL 9.4
* Bundler
* See Gemfile for the rest

=== Developer Bootstrap

Install all ruby dependencies
  bundle install
Create and Migrate the database
  rake db:create db:migrate
Run all test suites (rspec, jasmine, and cucumber)
  rake

=== Testing

To run the full test suite locally:
  rake

Here's what's included:

* rspec[https://github.com/rspec/rspec] for ruby and mvc testing.
* jasmine[https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine] for javascript testing.
* cucumber[https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber] for integration testing.

=== Continuous Integration (CI)

I set up {Travis CI}[https://travis-ci.org] here:
<br>
https://travis-ci.org/kurisu/lichti.org

=== Configuration

Even though this is a small, personal portal unlikely to get much attention, I decided to follow some scalability best
practices because it's a good habit and takes little effort.

==== App Server

I'm using puma[https://github.com/puma/puma], configured for both multiple works and threads, to make thread safety
a constant thought as I build the app.

To test the production app server/config locally, make sure you have the foreman gem installed and run it.

  gem install foreman
  foreman start

==== Staging

For pre-production testing, I set up a Staging environment here:
<br>
https://lichti-org-staging.herokuapp.com

==== Production

Production is here:
